remote access mySQL:

Locate the MySQL configuration file (my.cnf or my.ini).

Find the line that starts with bind-address or bind-address = 127.0.0.1.

Comment out the line by adding a # at the beginning, or replace the IP address with 0.0.0.0.

disable firewall:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="MySQL Port 3306" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3306

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

remote access postgreSQL:

C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\postgresql.conf.
Open the postgresql.conf file in a text editor.

Find the listen_addresses parameter and change it to listen on the IP address 
you want to allow remote connections from. 
To allow connections from any IP address, set it to '*'.

firewall disable:

Open the PowerShell console with administrative privileges. You can do this by searching for "PowerShell" 
in the Windows Start menu, right-clicking on "Windows PowerShell," and selecting "Run as administrator.":

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="PostgreSQL Port 5432" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5432

Restart PostgreSQL:

Open the Windows Start menu and search for "Services" and click on the "Services" app to open it.

In the Services window, locate the PostgreSQL service. The service name typically starts with "postgresql-" followed by the version number. For example, "postgresql-13".

Right-click on the PostgreSQL service and select "Restart" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can also click on the service to select it and then click on the "Restart" button in the toolbar at the top.

The PostgreSQL service will be restarted, and any configuration changes you made will take effect.

Grant Access to Remote Host:

Open the pg_hba.conf file, which is located in the same directory as postgresql.conf (e.g., C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\pg_hba.conf).

host    all    all    0.0.0.0/0    md5


Connect Remotely:

On your remote machine, you need to install a PostgreSQL client such as pgAdmin or the psql command-line tool.
Launch the PostgreSQL client and enter the IP address or hostname of the machine where PostgreSQL is running, along with the appropriate username and password.
Connect to the PostgreSQL server, and you should now have remote access.
